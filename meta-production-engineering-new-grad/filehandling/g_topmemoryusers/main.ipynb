    "\" i will use a list to collect all users with memory usage over 1000 MB, then sorting the list to get the top 3.  that takes O(N +k log k(sort)) time and O(k) space, where k is the number of matching users. Instead, I can with min-heap of size 3 to keep only the top 3 users as I read the file. This reduces the time to O(n + 3 log 3(sort)) and space to O(n), since the heap never stores more than 3 elements. So both time and space are better with the heap, especially for large log files\n"
