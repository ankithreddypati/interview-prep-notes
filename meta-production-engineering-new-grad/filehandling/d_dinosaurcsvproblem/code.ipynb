    " my initial approach is to scan dataset2.csv and collect all bipedal dinosaur names into a list.

But that results in O(m+nxk+klogk) time complexity because each lookup becomes a linear search. and space would be o(k)\n",

Then, we read dataset2.csv to filter only bipedal dinosaurs and compute their speed if their name exists in the dictionary — this takes O(m) time. For each of the k bipedal dinosaurs, we compute speed in O(1) time and store the result, which adds O(k) space. Finally, we sort the k results by speed, which takes O(k log k) time.
