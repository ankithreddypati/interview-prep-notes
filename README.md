# Interview Prep Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and resources for preparing for technical interviews.

## Structure
- Each folder is dedicated to a specific interview or company.
- Inside each folder, you'll find a README, diagrams (such as Excalidraw images), and other relevant materials.

### Example
