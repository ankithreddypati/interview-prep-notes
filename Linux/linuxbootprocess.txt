// what happens when you press the power button to start computer, linux boot proces

0. Power on
  |

1. BIOS/UEFI : a program called bios or uefi boots up ,which get all main parts of your computer ready for action
            keyboard, screen , harddrive ,and soon 
            UEFI is newer firmware spec offering faster boot times and secure boot 

            Bios is tied MasterBootRecord system(partitioning schemas on SSD/HDD first 512 bytes of disk sector0 
            ) which limit disk size to 2TB
            slow boot time , less secure

            UEFI, uses GUID partition table with no disk constraints
            faster boot time , secure boot

2. POST - bios/uefi runs a check called Poweronselftest , checks if all devices are working, if not we ll see an error 
on the screen

3.  after everything checksout with POST.  BIOS needs to find
and load up the boot loader software by selecting the preferred disk 
it has first pref as harddrive next is usb and so on 

4. in bios system usually bootloader in in MBR starting of the disk and in UEFI seperate partion wth .efi file
commonly used bios are grub2 

5. task of the grub is to find the operating sytem kernel (linux) on disk
 load the kernel to disk
bios hands over control to kernel


5. first the kernel decompresses itself on memory 
start initiating background processes and other device drivers 

6. kernel starts a init process which is systemd in modern computers in userspace .
User space is made for users: apps, terminals, shells, GUIs, etc
Kernel space is protected — users cannot directly access it (for safety & stability)
To interact with the kernel, users must go through:
System calls (e.g., read(), write(), etc.)
Commands like ls, cat, mkdir → internally call kernel APIs

7. systemd will mount the file system(/home, /proc),  background services and daemons(network mangeer , ssh , cron)
system tagert files to enter into the mode you want 
login service , display manger
